# Code Challenge - Class 26

## Code Challenge Topic: Insertion Sort

### Author: Timothee Odushina

### Problem Domain

Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Insertion Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

### Pseudocode

![Pseudocode](../Pseudocode.PNG)

### Sample Arrays

In your blog article, visually show the output of processing this input array:

[8,4,23,42,16,15]

For your own understanding, consider also stepping through these inputs:

* Reverse-sorted: [20,18,12,8,5,-2]
* Few uniques: [5,12,7,5,5,7]
* Nearly-sorted: [2,3,5,7,13,11]

### Implimentation

* Provide a visual step through for each of the sample arrays based on the provided pseudo code
* Convert the pseudo-code into working code in your language
* Present a complete set of working tests
